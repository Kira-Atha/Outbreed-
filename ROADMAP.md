# Outbreed - Roadmap

## Phase 1 – First Prototype (Core Player Controls)

- [ ] Create a `PlayerMovement` script (basic 2D movement with the new Input System)
- [ ] Add a Rigidbody2D and Collider2D to the player
- [ ] Make the player sprite move around the scene with keyboard input
- [ ] Add a Cinemachine Virtual Camera that follows the player
- [ ] Create a simple ground (tilemap or placeholder square) to walk on
- [ ] Add collision boundaries so the player cannot leave the play area

---

## Phase 2 – Interaction Basics

- [ ] Create an `Interactable` component (for chests, terminals, doors)
- [ ] Allow the player to press a key (ex: `E`) to interact
- [ ] Show a placeholder message in the Console or UI when interaction happens
